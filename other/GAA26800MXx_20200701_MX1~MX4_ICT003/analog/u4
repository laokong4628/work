   !  The following "on failure" block is provided to protect the
   !  asru sources from possible high voltages on the board
   !  under test.  If the voltages on the inputs to the device
   !  are not within the range from -10 volts to +10 volts peak
   !  relative to system/board ground, the test will abort.
   !
   !  Possible damage to the testhead may occur if this failure
   !  block is removed and high voltages are present on the
   !  device under test.
   !
   !  This failure block may be commented only if the input voltages
   !  to the device will not exceed the acceptable limits of -10 volts
   !  to +10 volts peak relative to system/board ground.

   !  In order to make this test more topologically insensitive and ensure that
   !  proper resources are included in the fixture, this test is written for
   !  four common topological cases:
   !
   !     Grounded_minus: - input is tied to board ground, the + input is driven
   !
   !     Grounded_plus:  + input is tied to board ground, the - input is driven
   !
   !     Follower:       - input is tied to output, the + input is driven
   !
   !     Differential:   both inputs are overdriven in complementary directions
   !
   !  In most cases, at least one of the tests will fail, depending on board
   !  topology.  Three of the tests per functional device should then be
   !  commented out.  To minimize testhead object size, the corresponding
   !  subtest body should be commented out as well, after final debug.
