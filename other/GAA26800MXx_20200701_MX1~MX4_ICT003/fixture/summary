Insufficient probing access has been provided on the node "OPTO_VCC", 
 causing the sense and power pins of supply 15 to share a probe.
 It is STRONGLY suggested that additional access locations be added to
 the node. This will enable the voltage to be sensed at the trace,
 on an independent probe, rather than on a power probe. (WARNING FXT77)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "OPTO_VCC" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)
Insufficient probing access has been provided on the node "RELAY_VCC", 
 causing the sense and power pins of supply 14 to share a probe.
 It is STRONGLY suggested that additional access locations be added to

 on an independent probe, rather than on a power probe. (WARNING FXT77)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "RELAY_VCC" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be

 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)
Insufficient probing access has been provided on the node "VCC2A+", 
 causing the sense and power pins of supply 13 to share a probe.
 It is STRONGLY suggested that additional access locations be added to
 the node. This will enable the voltage to be sensed at the trace,
 on an independent probe, rather than on a power probe. (WARNING FXT77)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "VCC2A+" and failed.  3 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "GND" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "VCC2A+" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "VCC2A+" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "VCC2A+" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 1.599.
            The standard deviation is 2.445.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 1053 interface pins for 694 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.659.

Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "VCC2A+" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

The board name G2A26800MXx in the fixture object must match the 
last portion of the board directory.  This is either the current 
directory or the directory passed to Module Pin Assignment. 
You may have copied the board directory from a directory whose name 
matched the board name stored in the fixture object to a 
directory whose name does not match. Please change the board 
name stored in the fixture object so that it is the same as the 
board directory name. (ERROR MPA102)

Insufficient probing access has been provided on the node "24V_SE", 
 causing the sense and power pins of supply 4 to share a probe.
 It is STRONGLY suggested that additional access locations be added to
 the node. This will enable the voltage to be sensed at the trace,
 on an independent probe, rather than on a power probe. (WARNING FXT77)
Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "24V_SE" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)

Program could not get the path to the board configuration file
   for board GAA26800MXx.
   If this is a single-board fixture, the most likely reason for this
   error is that the board name in the fixture object does not match
   the board directory name.  If this is a multiple-board
   fixture, this error means that there is no entry in the
   "fixture/boards" directory for board GAA26800MXx,
   yet board GAA26800MXx appears in the fixture object.

Fixture Tooling attempted to connect one probe per amp 
 of current on node "VCC2A+" and failed.  1 more probe(s) would be 
 required.  If no other warnings are observed, fixture tooling 
 was able to adequately connect the supply using the available 
 probes, however, changing probe contact resistance could cause 
 overdriving digital tests to fail intermittently. (WARNING FXT64)
