A power node does not have a defined state. Without a defined state,
  IPG cannot properly edit any tests which have pins tied to this node. IPG
  will be conservative in its editing, and may remove vectors that are
  usable. Please enter a state for all fixed nodes tied to digital devices. (WARNING IPG503)



A device has a pin tied to a fixed node for which no state was defined.
  This test may have vectors commented that would be usable. Please enter the
  states for all fixed nodes. (WARNING IPG504)



  Nodes on this board are not accessible.  Check the ipg/summary file 
  to identify the nodes, and verify that they should be inaccessible.



  A capacitor discharge test was generated, and is in the analog 
  directory.  Deletions of IPG-generated discharge statements in 
  the discharge file may result in damage to the scanner relays.



  Tests were generated for diodes and/or zeners that contain large-value
  parallel capacitors. To work correctly, including failing when the
  component is reversed, these tests may require a wait statement (wa) to
  be added manually.

A power node does not have a defined state. Without a defined state,
  IPG cannot properly edit any tests which have pins tied to this node. IPG
  will be conservative in its editing, and may remove vectors that are
  usable. Please enter a state for all fixed nodes tied to digital devices. (WARNING IPG503)



A device has a pin tied to a fixed node for which no state was defined.
  This test may have vectors commented that would be usable. Please enter the
  states for all fixed nodes. (WARNING IPG504)



  Nodes on this board are not accessible.  Check the ipg/summary file 
  to identify the nodes, and verify that they should be inaccessible.



  A capacitor discharge test was generated, and is in the analog 
  directory.  Deletions of IPG-generated discharge statements in 
  the discharge file may result in damage to the scanner relays.
